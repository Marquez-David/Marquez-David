\opening{Dear Recruiting Team,}

My name is David Márquez Mínguez, a Spanish computer engineer with solid experience in Front-End development. I have actively participated in several personal and 
work projects, demonstrating technical skills in JavaScript/Typescript, React, Astro, React Native...

Although my main focus is Front-End development, my university education and my self-taught spirit have allowed me to become familiar with several technologies 
outside this field. Among them, I highlight my knowledge in Java, Python, Scala, R, C/C++, Prolog, Racket...

On the other hand, the diversity of work experiences has provided me with a global and adaptable perspective allowing me to effectively address challenges and
formulate solutions that add value to users. Therefore, I consider myself an ideal candidate to contribute to the success of your team.

I appreciate your consideration and am available for an interview where I can provide more details about my technical skills.
